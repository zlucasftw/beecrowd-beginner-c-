# beecrowd - C# Beginner

Beginner problems section done with C# in algorithms and programming logic lecture given by the professor and instructor [*Mateus Ramos Pereira*](https://github.com/mateusrpereira). This repository is currently being made/updated as I recover the files of the solutions/problems.

**All the problems will be numbered as they are in [*beecrowd*](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjCytv5wq-EAxUMK7kGHTj_BGEQFnoECBQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.beecrowd.com.br%2Fjudge%2Fen%2Fruns&usg=AOvVaw2c9Ak1zFXT5aVuN4b55dTK&opi=89978449).
